pseudocode

win logic: 
p1 valg === cpu = tie!
p1 > spiller2 = p1 wins
p1 < cpu = cpu wins

score variables:
p1 = 0
cpu = 0
round_counter = 0

logic: 

playRound
(choose between rock paper, scissors) 
display results
check round win conditions:
(tied
p1 === cpu = tied (no points awarded)
round_counter += 1)
round_counter < 5? start new round.

(p1 > cpu? p1 wins) (round over, award point to p1) 
p1++;
round_counter++;
//if previous 2 conditions dont apply and round_counter < 5, award point to CPU and start new round
else (cpu wins) (award point, start new round)
round_counter += 1 
cpu++;
round_counter < 5? start new round.
if round_counter >= 5 ? print winner (the one with most points after 5 rounds)

separate function for round_win and game_win?
